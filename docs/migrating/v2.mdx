title: Migrating from v1.x to v2
description: Here's what you need to know to update your application to use the latest & greatest version of ort.

## `Environment` no more
The `Environment` struct has been removed. Only one `Environment` was allowed per process, so it didn't really make sense to have an environment as a struct.

To configure an `Environment`, you instead use the `ort::init` function, which returns the same `EnvironmentBuilder` as v1.x. Use `commit()` to then commit the environment.

```rust
ort::init()
    .with_execution_providers([CUDAExecutionProvider::default().build()])
    .commit()?;
```

`commit()` must be called before any sessions are created to take effect. Otherwise, a default environment will be created. The global environment can be updated afterward by calling `commit()` on another `EnvironmentBuilder`, however you'll need to recreate sessions after comitting the new environment in order for them to use it.

## Session creation
`SessionBuilder::new(&environment)` has been soft-replaced with `Session::builder()`:

```diff
-// v1.x
-let session = SessionBuilder::new(&environment)?.with_model_from_file("model.onnx")?;
+// v2
+let session = Session::builder()?.with_model_from_file("model.onnx")?;
```

## Session inputs

### `CowArray`/`IxDyn`/`ndarray` no longer required
One of the biggest usability changes is that the usual pattern of `CowArray::from(array.into_dyn())` is no longer required to create `Value`s. Now, `Value`s can be created from:
- Owned `Array`s of any dimensionality
- `ArrayView`s of any dimensionality
- Shared references to `CowArray`s of any dimensionality (i.e. `&CowArray<'_, f32, Ix3>`)
- Mutable references to `ArcArray`s of any dimensionality (i.e. `&mut ArcArray<f32, Ix3>`)
- A raw shape definition & data array, of type `(Vec<i64>, Arc<Box<[T]>>)`

```diff
-// v1.x
-let mut tokens = CowArray::from(Array1::from_iter(tokens.iter().cloned()).into_dyn());
+// v2
+let mut tokens = Array1::from_iter(tokens.iter().cloned());
```

It should be noted that there are some cases in which an array is cloned when converting into a `Value` which may lead to a surprising performance hit. ONNX Runtime does not expose an API to specify the strides of a tensor, so if an array is reshaped before being transformed into a `Value`, it must be cloned in order to make the data contiguous. Specifically:
- `&CowArray`, `ArrayView` will **always be cloned** (due to the fact that we cannot guarantee the lifetime of the array).
- `Array`, `&mut ArcArray` will only be cloned **if the memory layout is not contiguous**, i.e. if it has been reshaped.
- Raw data will never be cloned.

### `ort::inputs!` macro

v2.0 makes the transition to the new input/output system easier by providing an `inputs!` macro. This new macro allows you to specify inputs either by position as they appear in the graph (like previous versions), or by name.

The `ort::inputs!` macro will painlessly convert compatible data types (see above) into the new inputs system.

```diff
-// v1.x
-let chunk_embeddings = text_encoder.run(&[CowArray::from(text_input_chunk.into_dyn())])?;
+// v2
+let chunk_embeddings = text_encoder.run(ort::inputs![text_input_chunk]?)?;
```

Note the `?` after the macro call - `ort::inputs!` returns an `ort::Result<SessionInputs>`, so you'll need to handle any errors accordingly.

As mentioned, you can now also specify inputs by name using a map-like syntax. This is especially useful for graphs with optional inputs.
```rust
let noise_pred = unet.run(ort::inputs![
    "latents" => latents,
    "timestep" => Array1::from_iter([t]),
    "encoder_hidden_states" => text_embeddings.view()
]?)?;
```

You can also supply `ort::inputs!` your `IoBinding` by specifying `bind =`:
```rust
let binding = model.create_binding()?;
...
let outputs = model.run(ort::inputs![bind = binding]?)?;
```

### `Value::from_array` no longer requires the session's allocator
In previous versions, `Value::from_array` took an allocator parameter. The allocator was only used because the string data contained in string tensors had to be cloned into ONNX Runtime-managed memory. However, 99% of users only ever use primitive tensors, so the extra parameter served little purpose. `Value::from_array` now takes only an array, and the logic for converting string arrays has been moved to a new function, `Value::from_string_array`.

```diff
-// v1.x
-let val = Value::from_array(session.allocator(), &array)?;
+// v2
+let val = Value::from_array(&array)?;
```

### Separate string tensor creation
As previously mentioned, the logic for creating string tensors has been moved from `Value::from_array` to `Value::from_string_array`.

To use string tensors with `ort::inputs!`, you must create a `Value` using `Value::from_string_array`.

```rust
let array = ndarray::Array::from_shape_vec((1,), vec![document]).unwrap();
let outputs = session.run(ort::inputs![
    "input" => Value::from_string_array(session.allocator(), array)?
]?)?;
```

## Session outputs

### `try_extract` -> `extract_tensor`
v2.0 adds the groundwork for supporting sequence and maps types in `Value`s, so for clarity, the definition of `Value::try_extract` is made more explicit. No changes other than a rename are required.

```diff
-// v1.x
-let output1 = outputs[0].try_extract::<f32>()?;
+// v2
+let output1 = outputs[0].extract_tensor::<f32>()?;
```

### New: Retrieve outputs by name
Just like how inputs can now be specified by name, you can now retrieve session outputs by name.

```rust
let l = outputs["latents"].extract_tensor::<f32>()?;
```

## Execution providers
Execution provider structs with public fields have been replaced with builder pattern structs. See the [API reference](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-alpha.1/ort/index.html?search=ExecutionProvider) and the [execution providers reference](/perf/execution-providers) for more information.

```diff
-// v1.x
-builder = builder.with_execution_providers(ExecutionProvider::DirectML(DirectMLExecutionProvider {
-    device_id: 1
-}))?;
+// v2
+builder = builder.with_execution_providers([
+    DirectMLExecutionProvider::default()
+        .with_device_id(1)
+        .build()
+])?;
```

## Updated dependencies & features

### `ort::sys` has been split into `ort-sys`
The `ort::sys` module has been split out into [its own `ort-sys` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ort-sys). If you don't use `ort::sys` in your application, this won't affect you.

### `ndarray` is now optional
The dependency on `ndarray` is now declared optional. If you use `ort` with `default-features = false`, you'll need to add the `ndarray` feature.

## Model Zoo structs have been removed
ONNX pushed a new Model Zoo structure that adds hundreds of different models. This is impractical to maintain, so the built-in structs have been removed.

You can still use `Session::with_model_downloaded`, it just now takes a URL string instead of a struct.

## Changes to logging
Environment-level logging configuration (i.e. `EnvironmentBuilder::with_log_level`) has been removed because it could cause unnecessary confusion with our `tracing` integration.

## The Flattening
All modules except `download` are no longer public. Exports have been flattened to the crate root, so i.e. `ort::session::Session` becomes `ort::Session`.

## Renamed types
The following types have been renamed with no other changes.
- `NdArrayExtensions` -> `ArrayExtensions`
- `OrtOwnedTensor` -> `Tensor`
- `OrtResult`, `OrtError` -> `ort::Result`, `ort::Error`
- `TensorDataToType` -> `ExtractTensorData`
- `TensorElementDataType`, `IntoTensorElementDataType` -> `TensorElementType`, `IntoTensorElementType`
