import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

For ONNX Runtime, a **value** represents any type that can be given to/returned from a session or operator. Values come in three main types:
- **Tensors** (multi-dimensional arrays). This is the most common type of `Value`.
- **Maps** map a key type to a value type, similar to Rust's `HashMap<K, V>`.
- **Sequences** are homogenously-typed dynamically-sized lists, similar to Rust's `Vec<T>`. The only values allowed in sequences are tensors, or maps of tensors.

## Creating values

### Creating tensors
Tensors can be created with [`Tensor::from_array`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Tensor.html#method.from_array) from either:
- an [`ndarray::Array`](https://docs.rs/ndarray/0.16.1/ndarray/type.Array.html), or
- a tuple of `(shape, data)`, where:
    - `shape` is one of `Vec<I>`, `[I; N]` or `&[I]`, where `I` is `i64` or `usize`, and
    - `data` is one of `Vec<T>` or `Box<[T]>`.

```rs
let tensor = Tensor::from_array(ndarray::Array4::<f32>::zeros((1, 16, 16, 3)))?;

let tensor = Tensor::from_array(([1usize, 2, 3], vec![1.0_f32, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]))?;
```

The created tensor will take ownership of the passed data. See [Creating views of external data](#creating-views-of-external-data) to create temporary tensors referencing borrowed data.

### Creating maps & sequences
`Map`s can be [created](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Map.html#method.new) from any iterator yielding tuples of `(K, V)`, where `K` and `V` are tensor element types.

```rs
let mut map = HashMap::<String, f32>::new();
map.insert("one".to_string(), 1.0);
map.insert("two".to_string(), 2.0);
map.insert("three".to_string(), 3.0);

let map = Map::<String, f32>::new(map)?;
```

`Map`s can also be [created from 2 tensors](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Map.html#method.new_kv), one containing keys and the other containing values:
```rs
let keys = Tensor::<i64>::from_array(([4], vec![0, 1, 2, 3]))?;
let values = Tensor::<f32>::from_array(([4], vec![1., 2., 3., 4.]))?;

let map = Map::new_kv(keys, values)?;
```

`Sequence`s can be [created](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Sequence.html#method.new) from any iterator yielding a `Value` subtype:
```rs
let tensor1 = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 128, 128, 3])?;
let tensor2 = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 224, 224, 3])?;

let sequence: Sequence<Tensor<f32>> = Sequence::new(vec![tensor1, tensor2])?;
```

## Using values
Values can be used as an input in a session's [`run`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/session/struct.Session.html#method.run) function - either by value, by reference, or [by view](#views).
```rs
let latents = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 128, 128, 3])?;
let text_embedding = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1, 48, 256])?;
let timestep = Tensor::<f32>::new(&allocator, [1])?;

let outputs = session.run(ort::inputs![
    "timestep" => timestep,
    "latents" => &latents,
    "text_embedding" => text_embedding.view()
])?;
```

### Extracting data
To access the underlying data of a value directly, the data must first be **extracted**.

`Tensor`s can either [extract to an `ArrayView`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Tensor.html#method.extract_tensor), or [extract to a tuple](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Tensor.html#method.extract_raw_tensor) of `(&[i64], &[T])`, where the first element is the shape of the tensor, and the second is the slice of data contained within the tensor.
```rs
let array = ndarray::Array4::<f32>::ones((1, 16, 16, 3));
let tensor = TensorRef::from_array_view(&array)?;

let extracted: ArrayViewD<'_, f32> = tensor.extract_tensor();
let (tensor_shape, extracted_data): (&[i64], &[f32]) = tensor.extract_raw_tensor();
```

`Tensor`s and `TensorRefMut`s with non-string elements can also be mutably extracted with `extract_tensor_mut` and `extract_raw_tensor_mut`. Mutating the returned types will directly update the data contained within the tensor.
```rs
let mut original_array = vec![1_i64, 2, 3, 4, 5];
{
	let mut tensor = TensorRefMut::from_array_view_mut(([original_array.len()], &mut *original_array))?;
	let (extracted_shape, extracted_data) = tensor.extract_raw_tensor_mut();
	extracted_data[2] = 42;
}
assert_eq!(original_array, [1, 2, 42, 4, 5]);
```

`Map` and `Sequence` have [`Map::extract_map`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Map.html#method.extract_map) and [`Sequence::extract_sequence`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.Sequence.html#method.extract_sequence), which emit a `HashMap<K, V>` and a `Vec` of value [views](#views) respectively. Unlike `extract_tensor`, these types cannot mutably extract their data, and always allocate on each `extract` call, making them more computationally expensive.

Session outputs return `DynValue`s, which are values whose [type is not known at compile time](#dynamic-values). In order to extract data from a `DynValue`, you must either [downcast it to a strong type](#downcasting) or use a corresponding `try_extract_*` method, which fails if the value's type is not compatible:
```rs
let outputs = session.run(ort::inputs![TensorRef::from_array_view(&input)?])?;

let Ok(tensor_output): ort::Result<ndarray::ArrayViewD<f32>> = outputs[0].try_extract_tensor() else {
    panic!("First output was not a Tensor<f32>!");
}
```

## Views
A view (also called a ref) is functionally a borrowed variant of a value. There are also mutable views, which are equivalent to mutably borrowed values. Views are represented as separate structs so that they can be down/upcasted.

View types are suffixed with `Ref` or `RefMut` for shared/mutable variants respectively:
- Tensors have `DynTensorRef(Mut)` and `TensorRef(Mut)`.
- Maps have `DynMapRef(Mut)` and `MapRef(Mut)`.
- Sequences have `DynSequenceRef(Mut)` and `SequenceRef(Mut)`.

These views can be acquired with `.view()` or `.view_mut()` on a value type:
```rs
let my_tensor: ort::value::Tensor<f32> = Tensor::new(...)?;

let tensor_view: ort::value::TensorRef<'_, f32> = my_tensor.view();
```

Views act identically to a borrow of their type - `TensorRef` supports `extract_tensor`, `TensorRefMut` supports `extract_tensor_mut`. The same is true for sequences & maps.

### Creating views of external data
You can create `TensorRef`s and `TensorRefMut`s from views of external data, like an `ndarray` array, or a raw slice of data. These types act almost identically to a `Tensor` - you can extract them and pass them as session inputs - but as they do not take ownership of the data, they are bound to the input's lifetime.

```rs
let original_data = Array4::<f32>::from_shape_vec(...);
let tensor_view = TensorRef::from_array_view(original_data.view())?;

let mut original_data = vec![...];
let tensor_view_mut = TensorRefMut::from_array_view_mut(([1, 3, 64, 64], &mut *original_data))?;
```

## Dynamic values
Sessions in `ort` return a map of `DynValue`s. These are values whose exact type is not known at compile time. You can determine a value's [type](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/enum.ValueType.html) via its `.dtype()` method.

You can also use fallible methods to extract data from this value - for example, [`DynValue::try_extract_tensor`](https://docs.rs/ort/2.0.0-rc.9/ort/value/type.DynValue.html#method.try_extract_tensor), which fails if the value is not a tensor. Often times though, you'll want to reuse the same value which you are certain is a tensor - in which case, you can **downcast** the value.

### Downcasting
**Downcasting** means to convert a dyn type like `DynValue` to stronger type like `DynTensor`. Downcasting can be performed using the `.downcast()` function on `DynValue`:
```rs
let value: ort::value::DynValue = outputs.remove("output0").unwrap();

let dyn_tensor: ort::value::DynTensor = value.downcast()?;
```

If `value` is not actually a tensor, the `downcast()` call will fail.

#### Stronger types
`DynTensor` means that the type **is** a tensor, but the *element type is unknown*. There are also `DynSequence`s and `DynMap`s, which have the same meaning - the *kind* of value is known, but the element/key/value types are not.

The strongly typed variants of these types - `Tensor<T>`, `Sequence<T>`, and `Map<K, V>`, can be directly downcasted to, too:
```rs
let dyn_value: ort::value::DynValue = outputs.remove("output0").unwrap();

let f32_tensor: ort::value::Tensor<f32> = dyn_value.downcast()?;
```

If `value` is not a tensor, **or** if the element type of the value does not match what was requested (`f32`), the `downcast()` call will fail.

Stronger typed values have infallible variants of the `.try_extract_*` methods:
```rs
// We could try to extract a tensor directly from a `DynValue`...
let f32_array: ArrayViewD<f32> = dyn_value.try_extract_tensor()?;

// Or, we can first onvert it to a tensor, and then extract afterwards:
let tensor: ort::value::Tensor<f32> = dyn_value.downcast()?;
let f32_array = tensor.extract_tensor(); // no `?` required, this will never fail!
```

### Upcasting
**Upcasting** means to convert a strongly-typed value type like `Tensor<f32>` to a weaker type like `DynTensor` or `DynValue`. This can be useful if you have code that stores values of different types, e.g. in a `HashMap<String, DynValue>`.

Strongly-typed value types like `Tensor<f32>` can be converted into a `DynTensor` using `.upcast()`:
```rs
let dyn_tensor = f32_tensor.upcast();
// type is DynTensor
```

`Tensor<f32>` or `DynTensor` can be cast to a `DynValue` by using `.into_dyn()`:
```rs
let dyn_value = f32_tensor.into_dyn();
// type is DynValue
```

Upcasting a value doesn't change its underlying type; it just removes the specialization. You cannot, for example, upcast a `Tensor<f32>` to a `DynValue` and then downcast it to a `Sequence`; it's still a `Tensor<f32>`, just contained in a different type.

### Dyn views
Views also support down/upcasting via `.downcast()` & `.into_dyn()` (but not `.upcast()` at the moment).

You can also directly downcast a value to a stronger-typed view using `.downcast_ref()` and `.downcast_mut()`:
```rs
let tensor_view: ort::value::TensorRef<'_, f32> = dyn_value.downcast_ref()?;
// is equivalent to
let tensor_view: ort::value::TensorRef<'_, f32> = dyn_value.view().downcast()?;
```

### Conversion recap
- `DynValue` represents a value that can be any type - tensor, sequence, or map. The type can be retrieved with `.dtype()`.
- `DynTensor`, `DynMap`, and `DynSequence` are values with known container types, but unknown element types.
- `Tensor<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, and `Sequence<T>` are values with known container and element types.
- `Tensor<T>` and co. can be converted from/to their dyn types using `.downcast()`/`.upcast()`, respectively.
- `Tensor<T>`/`DynTensor` and co. can be converted to `DynValue`s using `.into_dyn()`.

<Callout type='info'>
    Note that `DynTensor` cannot be downcast to `Tensor<T>`, but `DynTensor` can be upcast to `DynValue` with `.into_dyn()`, and then downcast to `Tensor<T>` with `.downcast()`.

    Type casting is computationally cheap; upcasts and `.into_dyn()` compile to a no-op.
