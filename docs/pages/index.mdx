`ort` makes it easy to deploy your machine learning models to production via [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/), a hardware-accelerated inference engine. With `ort` + ONNX Runtime, you can run almost any ML model (including ResNet, YOLOv8, BERT, LLaMA) on almost any hardware, often far faster than PyTorch, and with the added bonus of Rust's efficiency.

[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) is an interoperable neural network specification. Your ML framework of choice -- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, PaddlePaddle, etc. -- turns your model into an ONNX graph comprised of basic operations like `MatMul` or `Add`. This graph can then be converted into a model in another framework, or **inferenced directly with ONNX Runtime**.

<img width="100%" src="/assets/sample-onnx-graph.png" alt="An example visual representation of an ONNX graph, showing how an input tensor flows through layers of convolution nodes." />

Converting a neural network to a graph representation like ONNX opens the door to more optimizations and broader acceleration hardware support. ONNX Runtime can significantly improve the inference speed/latency of most models and enable acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA & TensorRT, Intel OpenVINO, Qualcomm QNN, Huawei CANN, and [much more](/perf/execution-providers).

`ort` is the Rust gateway to ONNX Runtime, allowing you to infer your ONNX models via an easy-to-use and ergonomic API. Many commercial, open-source, & research projects use `ort` in some pretty serious production scenarios to boost inference performance:
- [**Bloop**](https://bloop.ai/)'s semantic code search feature is powered by `ort`.
- [**SurrealDB**](https://surrealdb.com/)'s powerful SurrealQL query language supports calling ML models, including ONNX graphs through `ort`.
- [**Google's Magika**](https://github.com/google/magika) file type detection library is powered by `ort`.
- [**Wasmtime**](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), an open-source WebAssembly runtime, supports ONNX inference for the [WASI-NN standard](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn) via `ort`.
- [**`rust-bert`**](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) implements many ready-to-use NLP pipelines in Rust à la Hugging Face Transformers with both [`tch`](https://crates.io/crates/tch) & `ort` backends.

# Getting started
<Steps>

### Add ort to your Cargo.toml
If you have a [supported platform](/setup/platforms) (and you probably do), installing `ort` couldn't be any simpler! Just add it to your Cargo dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
ort = "=2.0.0-rc.9"
```

### Convert your model
Your model will need to be converted to an ONNX graph before you can use it.
- The awesome folks at Hugging Face have [a guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/serialization) to export 🤗 Transformers models to ONNX with 🤗 Optimum.
- For any PyTorch model: [`torch.onnx`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html)
- For `scikit-learn` models: [`sklearn-onnx`](https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/)
- For TensorFlow, Keras, TFlite, & TensorFlow.js: [`tf2onnx`](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx)
- For PaddlePaddle: [`Paddle2ONNX`](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle2ONNX)

### Load your model
Once you've got a model, load it via `ort` by creating a [`Session`](/fundamentals/session):

```rust
use ort::session::{builder::GraphOptimizationLevel, Session};

let mut model = Session::builder()?
    .with_optimization_level(GraphOptimizationLevel::Level3)?
    .with_intra_threads(4)?
    .commit_from_file("yolov8m.onnx")?;
```

### Perform inference
Preprocess your inputs, then `run()` the session to perform inference.

```rust
let outputs = model.run(ort::inputs!["image" => image]?)?;
let predictions = outputs["output0"].try_extract_tensor::<f32>()?;
...
```

# Next steps
<Steps>

### Unlock more performance with EPs
Use [execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) to enable hardware acceleration in your app and unlock the full power of your GPU or NPU.

### Optimize I/O with `IoBinding`
Control where and when inputs/outputs end up with [`IoBinding`](/perf/io-binding) to maximize I/O efficiency.

### Go beyond ONNX Runtime
Deploy your application to WASM with `ort`'s [`tract`](/backends/tract) or [`candle`](/backends/candle) backends.

### Show off your project!
We'd love to see what you've made with `ort`! Show off your project in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pykeio/ort/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uQtsNu2xMa).
