title: Platform support
description: ONNX Runtime, and by extension `ort`, supports a wide variety of platforms. For most desktop users, pre-built binaries are available, so setting up `ort` is as simple as adding it to your `Cargo.toml`!

Here are the supported platforms and binary availability status, as of v2.0.0-rc.4.

* 🟢 - Supported. Dynamic & static binaries provided by pyke.
* 🔷 - Supported. Static binaries provided by pyke.

<p>¶ WASM supports a limited subset of ONNX Runtime features. For more info, see [the docs on WebAssembly support](/setup/webassembly).</p>

If your platform is marked as 🟢 or 🔷, you're in luck! Almost no setup will be required to get `ort` up and running.

For platforms marked as ⭕, you'll need to [compile ONNX Runtime from source](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/) and then [link `ort` to your custom binaries](/setup/linking) (but don't worry, we made this setup as simple as possible!)

<Callout type='info'>
    Certain execution providers may not have binaries available. You can check EP binary support in the [Execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) documentation.
